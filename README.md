# ESI-Website
This project is gonna be a first for me in terms of using HTML, CSS, and possibly Javascript. Additionally, I'll be implementing the EVE Swagger Interface into my website which is also a new concept for me (implementing an API). I don't know how long this is all gonna take but I'm just hoping to get some more programming knowledge and experience out of the whole project regardless of where I end up. I'm looking forward to the challenges ahead and the opportunities to become a better programmer.
